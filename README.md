👋 Hi, I’m Amar

AI Application Builder | LLM Systems • Prompt Engineering • Business-Focused Automation

I build practical AI-powered applications that translate business problems into working systems—using LLMs, structured prompts, and lightweight Python backends.
My focus is not model theory, but decision support, automation, and usable tools.

Final-year B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering (Business Systems) student, graduating 2026.
